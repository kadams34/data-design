            <h2>Use Case</h2>
            <p>It's that time of year! Will is making his annual trip to Denver to visit friends and family, but mainly to catch a Broncos
                game! A long time friend of Will's has access to season tickets and always has an extra for him every year. Unfortunately
                this year, Will's friend had to secure Will's ticket for an unexpected family visitor. Will's friend suggested using
                <a href="http://stubhub.com">stubhub.com</a> as it's worked well for him in the past. Will sure as heck didn't make the
                drive to Colorado just to watch it on TV. <a href="http://www.stubhub.com">Stubhub</a> it is!</p>
